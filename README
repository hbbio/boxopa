Box.app is a simple file sharing app.

Users can easily create a new box just by visiting
the homepage.  Inside their box, users can upload whatever
files they want, which will instantly be available to all
viewers of the page!  Users can also easily delete their
files.  No login necessary.

Instructions

1. Compile:
    opa box.opa

2. Run!
    ./box.js
    Visit: localhost:8080

Would love any feedback.
